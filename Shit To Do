Moderation
- Make it so the bot only works in one channel - so two ways to handle. check for perms, or set up bot using commands
- Mute - done 03/02/20, needs check, needs to add duration and warning
- temp mute, ban, kick commands
- unban, unmute commands
- Warn user, should be PMed by the bot
- clear messages from channel, maybe from a given date to a given date


User profile
- Figure out how to start a user profile? keeps track of infractions
- Add authorisation - if users have perms to use this command

Misc
- Figure out how to read from config files
- learn hashmaps or lists to make a command system
- segregate commands using prefixes (? or ! or .), eg. mods use ! and users use . and ?
- getArgs? what that
