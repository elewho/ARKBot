Shit To Do
- Automatically add author to the created role - Done 13/11/20
- Bot automatically reacts to role - Done 13/11/20
- Users who react to the role will be added to role - check this
- Users who unreact to the role will be removed from the role
- Add check if role already exists - Done 15/11/20
- Figure out how to read from config files
- Make it so the bot only works in one channel - so two ways to handle. check for perms, or set up bot using commands
- Mute, temp mute, ban, kick commands
- unban, unmute commands
- Warn user, should be PMed by the bot
- Figure out how to start a user profile? keeps track of infractions
- clear messages from channel, maybe from a given date to a given date
